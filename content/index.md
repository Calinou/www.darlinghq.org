Darling is a translation layer that allows you to run unmodified macOS binaries on Linux. In its nature, it is similar to the well-known [Wine project](http://www.winehq.org).

At this point, does not yet run macOS application with a GUI. For more information, review the [Project Status](/project-status). Developers are always welcome to join the project - take a look at [Low Hanging Fruit](/developer-zone/low-hanging-fruit/).
