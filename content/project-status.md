# Project Status

Currently, Darling is capable of running many console tools or applications. Examples include Appleâ€™s Toolchain, Midnight Commander and many other packages from [Rudix.org](http://www.rudix.org). While this may not be very interesting for end-users, every project must start with a rock-solid foundation to remain viable in the future.

Developers may find Darling interesting as a playground to work on something extraordinary. There is a lot of work ahead of us, but not so much to have usable results.
